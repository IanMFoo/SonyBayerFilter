	Restricts optimization by averaging the calculated sensitivity in the vertical direction within EACH layer, such that voxels 
	within each layer are governed by a shared 2D profile.
	i.e. n layers, 1 layer has m voxels, all voxels have a shared 2D permittivity profile WITHIN the nth layer, but each layer differs from the rest in its 2D profile
