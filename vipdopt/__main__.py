        gradient. The maximum operator is used to ensure the weights are never negative, thus ignoring the gradient of 
        high-performing figures of merit rather than forcing the figure of merit to decrease. The 2/N factor is used to ensure all

        is non-differentiable, this function is used only to apply the gradient rather than to compute it. Therefore, it does not
